#Snake
Classic snake game that runs in terminal. Written with C, currently only works in Windows because of OS specific console clear commands and input listening without buffering.

# Installation and running
You need to compile the snake_on_terminal.c file. 

- Tested on Windows using MinGW, running the following command works 
`gcc -o snake.exe snake_on_terminal.c`
- After that you can run the game with just `snake.exe`
